Assignment 1 CS456 Computer Networks
A congestion controlled pipelined RDT
Goal: to implement a congestion controlled pipelined Reliable Data Transfer
(RDT) protocol over UDP, which could be used to transfer a text file from one
host to another across an unreliable network.

Makefile not used since coded in python

Execution example:
replace numbers with applicable open sockets
./nEmulator 9991 host2 9994 9993 host3 9992 1 0.2 0
./receiver host1 9993 9994 <output File>
./sender host1 9991 9992 50 <input file>

Outputs:
data from <input file> to <output File>
ack.log - acks received by sender
N.log - N updates in receiver
seqnum.log - seqnum of packets sent by sender
arrival.log - seqnum of arrivals at receiver
