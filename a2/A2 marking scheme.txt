CS 456/656 A2 Marking Sheet

[15] (Directly connect sender & receiver) Successfully transmit a file without delay and loss. Test seqnum.log, ack.log and arrival.log. N must not reset all the time for
	[5] a file less than 10 packets (6 packets ) without delay and loss.
	[10] a file larger than 32 packets (43 packets) without delay and loss.

[25] (Connect sender & receiver to nEmulator) Successfully transmit a file with delay and loss

[10] Logging	
	[-10] Logs not recorded
	[-5] Logs incorrectly recorded

[5] Timer: exactly one timer    

[5] Window: sliding dynamic window, starts at N=1, increasing size with new ACKs, capped at 10 packets   

[5] Packet
	[-5] Packet format not respected

[30] Simplified TCP behavior. Test seqnum.log, ack.log, N.log and arrival.log.   
	[10] data/ACK with delay and loss, test receiver side behavior (buffer out-of-order packets)	
	[5] data/ACK with delay and loss, test receiver side behavior (cumulative ACK)	
	[5] data/ACK with delay and loss, test sender side behavior (discard duplicate ACKs)              
	[10] data/ACK with delay and loss, test sender side behavior (Timeout, retransmission, reset N)                           

[5] Other Implementation Issues
	[-5] No README/Makefile when applicable
	[-5] Bad code style/no comments
